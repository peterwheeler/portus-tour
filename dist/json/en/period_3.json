By this time, the Roman Empire had achieved an unprecedented degree of political cohesion, and had been ruled by a succession of emperors of provincial origin, a development that was symptomatic of a high degree of social integration across the Empire.<br/><br/>After the completion of the Trajanic enlargements, the Palazzo Imperiale and other administrative buildings at the heart of the port witnessed continued construction in the course of the later 2<sup>nd</sup> century AD. Across Portus as a whole, mounting evidence suggests that this period, and extending into the end of Septimius Severus reign in AD 211 was a time of renewed construction of buildings and alterations to existing complexes. This activity was especially obvious in the Palazzo Imperiale."

Perhaps the large ships bringing grain from North Africa and Egypt would have moored in the protection of the outer basin, until allocated a slot to unload in the Trajanic basin. Whilst we cannot be sure how it worked, and lack the crucial written documentation, we do have a sense of the mammoth scale of the task."
