The Palazzo Imperiale was a brick- and reticulate-faced concrete structure which covered nearly three hectares. Of its original three storeys, only the substructures and some of the first floor remain. The Palazzo‘s trapezoidal plan dictated the planning of the spur of land between the two basins on which it was situated. Here and there you can see the vaulted spaces leading into the surviving basement levels, including the long tunnel or cryptoporticus that runs the whole length of the Terraza di Traiano.<br/><br/>The structure has been of significant interest since the 16<sup>th</sup> century due to the discoveries of numerous columns, sculptures and inscriptions. The complex also contained its own bath suite in its southwest corner. The corpus of brickstamps found in the building indicates it was a predominantly Trajanic construction with later renovations undertaken by Hadrian and the Antonines. The building’s location as well as the evidence of its lavish marble decoration suggests it was presumably the headquarters of a high-ranking official or potentially the emperor himself on periodic voyages in and out of the port.<br><br>View on <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/1jTQKd32zht' target='_blank'>Google Maps</a> or <a href='http://binged.it/1sAQm9O' target='_blank'>Bing Maps</a><span style='font-size: 11px;'>  (Desktop Only)</span>"
