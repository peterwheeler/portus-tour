Turning yet further we see the quay extending to the east, capped with the remains of the Lanterna Baths. Next we see the modern Casale – the centre of operations of the Portus Project for many years. From behind the Casale we then see the Grandie Magazzini di Setimio Severo.

The Palazzo Imperiale was a brick- and reticulate-faced concrete structure which covered nearly three hectares. Of its original three storeys, only the substructures and some of the first floor remain. The Palazzo‘s trapezoidal plan dictated the planning of the spur of land between the two basins on which it was situated. Here and there you can see the vaulted spaces leading into the surviving basement levels, including the long tunnel or cryptoporticus that runs the whole length of the Terraza di Traiano.<br/><br/>The structure has been of significant interest since the 16th century due to the discoveries of numerous columns, sculptures and inscriptions. The complex also contained its own bath suite in its southwest corner. The corpus of brickstamps found in the building indicates it was a predominantly Trajanic construction with later renovations undertaken by Hadrian and the Antonines. The building’s location as well as the evidence of its lavish marble decoration suggests it was presumably the headquarters of a high-ranking official or potentially the emperor himself on periodic voyages in and out of the port."

The Palazzo Imperiale was a brick- and reticulate-faced concrete structure which covered nearly three hectares. Of its original three storeys, only the substructures and some of the first floor remain. The Palazzo‘s trapezoidal plan dictated the planning of the spur of land between the two basins on which it was situated. Here and there you can see the vaulted spaces leading into the surviving basement levels, including the long tunnel or cryptoporticus that runs the whole length of the Terraza di Traiano.<br/><br/>The structure has been of significant interest since the 16th century due to the discoveries of numerous columns, sculptures and inscriptions. The complex also contained its own bath suite in its southwest corner. The corpus of brickstamps found in the building indicates it was a predominantly Trajanic construction with later renovations undertaken by Hadrian and the Antonines. The building’s location as well as the evidence of its lavish marble decoration suggests it was presumably the headquarters of a high-ranking official or potentially the emperor himself on periodic voyages in and out of the port."

The building is composed of brick-faced concrete piers with a series of brick arches extending north-south along the piers forming parallel bays which stretched from the Claudian to the Trajanic basins.

AD, when this residence was converted into an early Christian church (basilica) c. 37m long by c. 20m wide. It comprised a large hall oriented from north to south and consisting of a nave and two flanking aisles with geometric and figured mosaic floors; it was approached through an east-west hall. This building was almost certainly under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Portus – an individual who is first attested in AD 314."

The site itself extends far in every direction and on our website and as a learner on our free online course you can get an idea of the wider landscape and all the other fascinating buildings and other archaeological remains."
